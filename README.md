# super-explorer
**Concept**: Currently we have different tools to open / view different contents like an explorer to view directories, text editor to view text files, web browser to view web sites or search for content over internet.
However it'd be cooler to have an explorer, that treat every content be it - `directory`, `file`, `music`, `web page`, `videos` etc as one, and show them to user in a similar fasion.

**Status**: Infant
